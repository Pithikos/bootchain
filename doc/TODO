TO CHANGE
* RETURN_VALUE should propagate until changed explicitly with BASH's exit.
  Remove set_return_value since it's rather ambiguous.
* superexport_var - export variables to parent
* TARGET -> relative path to current bootstrap
* Cleanup of Bootchain should be trapped on EXIT. Thus even malfunctions
  will not leak info (in the form of files).

TO ADD
* TARGET_FILE -> filename of target

TO CLEANUP
* Remove all set_return_value stuff
