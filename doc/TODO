CHANGE
* TARGET -> relative path to current bootstrap
* What if user traps on EXIT? Then we can't tell
  if there is implicit or explicit exit.
* Add -R flag to run all files in subfolders (don't run bootstrap itself)


ASSURE
* Bootstrap filename extensions are omitted

ADD
* TARGET_FILE -> filename of target
* Automatically chmod +x each bootstrap
