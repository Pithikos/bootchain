Return value
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Master Child1
       Child2
       
       
RETURN_VALUE must propagate from child to master and then from master
to the other child.

PROBLEM: What if bootstrap_wait absent? No problem, since children
         without that are already dead (non-suspended children - remember?).


                





Interprocess communication simple solutions:

SIGNAL+fifo_file
Sender:
 1. set value in pipe &
 2. signal receiver

Receiver:
 1. read_msg () { read fifo_file} 
 2. trap "read_msg" SIGx

Sender and receiver can be parent OR child. To be able and use this:


# Other user must have
send_msg () { #string #pid
   
}

wait_msg () {
   
   
}
