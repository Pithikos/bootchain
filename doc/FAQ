##Do bootstraps run recursively?

Bootstraps do behave as if they are running recursively. However
in practice Bootchain acts as the parent process that synchronises
everything. This implementation makes the code more robust.

Keep in mind that in this case no data is passed from one bootstrap to
the next.


##Why execute bootstraps linearly and not recursively?

The initial idea was to execute the bootstrap scripts recursively since
that is what we are trying to do with Bootchain - run scripts recursively.
However there are some reasons that the linear implementation is
prefarable:

* Less overhead when the number of bootstraps increases.
* Each bootstrap has no children and therefore can act
  as a simple BASH script without weird behaviours (like export for example)
* Greater control since Bootchain can decide what to do with each bootstrap
  since it's its immediate child.
* We are not locked to using recursion in every bootstrap.
* Because we are not locked, we can run any BASH script without a change.

The linear implementation is a bit more complex but in the long end it
pays off.


##Why ./ (background process) and no . (source)?

Each bootstrap is run as background process instead of sourcing it.

Source can't be used because some of the bootstraps will be running (even if
they are suspended) at the same time. By default `source` can't do that.

Ofcourse you could run source with an ampersand (&) to run the whole
thing in a separate process. But then you get the same behaviour as if
you ran the whole thing as a background process from the beginning so we
come back to the same problem.


##Parent/children synchronisation

The parent and children communicate in two different way. For synchroni-
sation purposes they use the signal SIGCONT. This is used by any of the
two when they want to tell the other partner to continue, if they are
"suspended".

Since signals can't propagate values, a second method is nessasary.
To return values from a child to a previous child, named pipes are used.
This is only in case the last child exits with a number code. (In BASH
this is by using 'exit 0' for example.)

Signals can be concidered redudndant since we could have used named pipes
for the synchronisation as well. However, having both, makes the program
to work in the same way even if we don't return a return command  at the
last bootstrap.


##Signals vs Named pipes

Named pipes can't be used by bootstrap_wait because then we would need
a unique pipe for each individual child which becomes cumbersome.

For this reason signals have to combine with pipes so that there is only
one process at a time waiting at a pipe end.

In practice, signals can be used for the synchronisation until we reach
the latest bootstrap. After that we need to combine signals with pipe.
Namely we signal the previous child that we have created a pipe that it
can read.


##How can a bootstrap communicate with an other one?

The easiest way is to use export_var to make a variable be inherited
to felow bootstraps. If you want more power you can however use the
common ways of inter-process communication like signals, pipes, sockets,
files, etc. Just keep in mind that Bootchain uses internally the SIGCONT
signal so don't use that. Also it uses some named pipes and files found
in /tmt/. Each file is being prepended with the prefix "bootchain_".


##How does export_var work?

It essentially appends the variable in a file. Then bootchain just exports
each individual variable to the next child it creates. This way the next
bootstrap script can use the variables directly in the whole script. The
variables accumulate in this file and are then being exported to every
child.

##Can I see all variables exported?

You can see the variables you manually exported with export_var
by simply checking the appropriate file in /tmt. Check the configuration
in the Bootchain file and specifically the variable $vars_file that holds
the path to that file.


##What's the scope of API variables?

Well there are two types of variables. The ones exported with export_var
and the ones provided by the API. The API variables like $TARGET are
bootstrap-specific. That means that for every bootstrap, they might dither.
The ones that you manually export with export_var are exported to ALL
children. Keep in mind that these values will be static ones exported,
meaning that they are not going to update automatically.


##How does bootstrap_wait work?

bootstrap_wait mainly waits for the next bootstrap to finish. In practice
it does a bit more than just wait for the process to finish. For example
among the things it does is to acknowledge to Bootchain that the
script has executed successfully this far.


##How do I return a value?

You can do it two ways. You can either use either BASH's `exit` or
Bootchain's set_return_value.
