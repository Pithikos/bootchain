This file contains some practical information on how to achieve common
things.






Multiple targets
========================================================================
Target is the path you use with bootchain

Essentially you run BOOTCHAIN with a list of paths. The path should
be to the program or script you are trying to run.

BOOTCHAIN will automatically look for bootstrap scripts between itself
and the 



Return value
========================================================================
Normally the last bootstrap's return value will be returned to all
other bootstraps. For this reason if you want the return value to corre-
spond to the value of the program or script you ran, you should use BASH's
`exit` or the API's set_return_value.

These functions will work only on the last bootstrap. Putting them in any
intermediate bootstraps will have no effect on the RETURN_VALUE. This is
desired as in that way, you can have `exit` in your cleanup without
altering the return value of the main program/script you just ran.

If you want to return more information then you could use *Unix standard
ways like files, named pipes, sockets etc.
